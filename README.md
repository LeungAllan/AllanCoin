Learning for create and issue ERC20 crypto token

It is really amazing how easy to create my own token for testing!

The following is my experience:
Originally, I try to follow Ethereum Project website to create my own token but I found it connect to testnet very very slow.
Finally, I found that there has a Chrome (Browser) extension which is Ethereum wallet and its youtube video show it can easy create own token.
Thus, I follow it to create my first token. It is really easy!

The following is some very interesting and useful link for newbies.
